Hi. I'm John. I'm an instructional technologist at an independent school. I want to become a developer and build better solutions for students.

### What I'm Learning

I’ve been using four main sources for learning web development so far: Codeacademy, Treehouse, Ruby Monks, and Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial. From these resources, I’ve begun to acquire a strong working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Ruby, Javascript, JQuery, Git, and Heroku.

### What I'm Making
[![TEDx Hammond School](http://johnkeith.github.io/aboutme/img/tedxcap.jpg)](http://www.tedxhammondschool.com)

Right now, I’m designing a TEDx website for Hammond School. The site is a minimal one page design built on Bootstrap. [HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap 3]

I also design and maintain the backend for a Wordpress blog: <a href="http://www.scrumptiouslyskinny.com">Scrumptiously Skinny</a>. The site is built on the Genesis framework and is fully responsive. [HTML, CSS, a little PHP, Wordpress, Genesis]

Additionally, I've built a few portfolio pages to test out things I've been learning along the way. You can check them out below.
