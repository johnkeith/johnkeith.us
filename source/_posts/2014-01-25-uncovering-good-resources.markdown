There are two parts about learning web development that I have found consistently difficult.

1. Finding a sensible path through the myriad of resources for learning to code

2. Staying focused

I think these two go hand-in-hand. After moving beyond a walled garden like Codeacademy, finding out where to go and what to tackle next is really hard! There is such a vast array of languages and frameworks to try that it is baffling to try and decipher what will be most beneficial to learn. 

All things considered, I'm not sure this is really something to worry much about. Diving into almost any language at this point will help me further the skills I have gained and develop a greater understanding of how all these different moving pieces of the web fit together.

That said, I am concerned about losing focus. I've learned a great deal about Ruby and I want to keep moving forward with it (especially after learning about you can make iOS apps using RubyMotion!), but I keep getting excited (side-tracked) by all kinds of shiny new development tools I'm finding. 

For example, the last couple of days I've been playing with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) and loving it! Since I'm going to be heading off to coding bootcamp soon, I figure it would be a good choice to wait on learning Rails until I get there and instead focus on exploring other Ruby-based frameworks. (Also, Sinatra is a heck of a lot easier to wrap your head around than Rails!). 

So, in order to keep myself on the right path, I'm going to work on building stuff with Sinatra ([this tutorial](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/06/08/designing-with-class-sinatra-plus-postgresql-plus-heroku/) really was a great way to start), while continuing to read and work on Ruby fundamentals. Speaking of great resources, I finished TestFirst.org's [Learn Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) last weekend and that was an awesome way to start applying the Ruby I've learned. [My solutions](https://github.com/johnkeith/testfirstruby) could certainly use some work, but I think these kinds of test-driven coding challenges are the best way for me to keep moving forward with Ruby at this point.
