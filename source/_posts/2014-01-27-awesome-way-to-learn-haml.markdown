I've been meaning to take some time and learn one of the HTML templating engines. One of the best parts about the [Codepen](http://www.codepen.com) site is that it is a great place to practice with engines like HAML and Slim. (Not to mention, doing so gives me a chance to try installing the Codepen plugin here on my Octopress).
