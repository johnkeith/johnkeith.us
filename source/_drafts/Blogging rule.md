Remember that Michael Pollan quote about eating?

Eat food. Not too much. Mostly Plants.

A similar strategy can be applied to blogging. Here's the rule I propose for anyone new looking to start blogging (one that is specifically aimed at developers starting to learn their craft).

Write often. Not too long. For your personal betterment. 

Blogging certainly can take our focus away from what is most important in life: building things (careers, relationships, furniture), spending time with friends and family, staying fit and enjoying the great outdoors. Blogging can also, however, strengthen what we are learning and the connections we make between our learning and the world around us. Use blogging to reflect, to deepen your understanding of relationships in your life and the world, but do not let it become a relationship in and of itself. 

Rule of thumb: sit down, write for 13 minutes a day, with yourself as the only audience. (But do share, as you never know when a passing thought in your eye might be wisdom to another, and our world is always in want of wisdom). Do this consistently and the habit will yield tremendous rewards.
