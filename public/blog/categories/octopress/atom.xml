    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I came across Riley Hillard&rsquo;s tutorial on making a <a href="http://rileyh.com/treehouse-badges-widget/">Treehouse badges widget</a>, I knew I had to have something like this on my site. While I considered using Riley&rsquo;s fantastic <a href="http://reportcard.rileyh.com/">ReportCard.js</a>, it dawned on me that recreating the widget might be a great way to get more experience working with hashes, JSON and the like. After a bit of experimentation on <a href="http://codepen.io/johnkeith/pen/ocIaj">Codepen</a>, I had a functional piece of jQuery and a little CSS to give it a decent appearance (though really that’s mostly due to those spiffy looking badges).</p>

<p>I toyed with the idea of crafting a Liquid Tag that could be used anywhere in a Octopress blog, but decided on building it as widget for the sidebar instead. To make it a little more interesting, I did end up writing a Rake file to automatically add the widget&rsquo;s files into your Octopress folder and add the proper configuration variables to _config.yml.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since Heroku only allows for 300 MB of storage for their free tier of hosting, it makes sense to store the images for an Octopress site in a separate location. Previously, I used Flickr for a few posts, but the process of uploading the files and hunting down the embed link was tiresome.</p>

<p>The better way, it seems, is to use Google Drive, despite the fact that Google doesn&rsquo;t provide an easy way to embed either. What makes using Google Drive much friendlier than Flickr, however, is a site called <a href="http://gdurl.com/%E2%80%8B">gdURL</a>.</p>

<p>With gdURL, all you need to do is share an image file on Google Drive, change the privacy settings to &ldquo;Anyone who has the link can view&rdquo;, then run the link Google Drive provides you through the gdURL service and you receive a tidy, bite-sized link for embedding your image.</p>

<p>For instance, I used gdURL in the following line to link to a picture of this site&rsquo;s new theme.</p>

<p><code>
![So Fresh and So Green](http://gdurl.com/i4Wr)​
</code></p>

<p><img src="http://gdurl.com/i4Wr" alt="So Fresh and So Green" />​</p>

<p>Quick, easy, and keeps the size of your Octopress repo down.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to build an Octopress theme since I put this site up back in January. To start with, this blog was using the <a href="https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace">Whitespace theme</a>, which was a fantastic starting point, but I wanted to create something with a little more&hellip;color!</p>

<p>After reading Vladi&rsquo;s post about creating a theme called <a href="http://vladigleba.com/blog/2013/10/31/introducing-readify-a-new-octopress-theme-focused-on-readibility/">Readify</a>, I was inspired to take a shot at it.</p>

<p>To that end&hellip;here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got so far. The code is <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/sofreshandsogreen">available here</a>, should you want to install it on your own Octopress! I reworked the Classc theme to include a few basic changes that hopefully will make it more readable and usable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Larger font and line heights</li>
<li>Fixed navbar that becomes unfixed on mobile devices</li>
<li>Green everywhere!</li>
</ul>
