    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are now officially halfway through our ten weeks at Launch. What I&rsquo;m still marveling at after five weeks is how Launch Academy is transforming me as a learner.</p>

<p>Pre-Launch, back in high school and college, I was a very learn-by-the-book kind of guy. I would read cover to cover any text put in front of me, but asking me to jump into a topic or domain without much preparation beforehand was always a struggle.</p>

<p>One great part about learning web development is that the read first, execute later approach I relied on in the past does not work. I&rsquo;ve felt myself constantly challenged the past few weeks to dive into projects knowing only enough to get started and then to seek out only the knowledge I need to complete to reach the goal.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I guess this is what makes project-based learning powerful: the fact that the knowledge you acquire is all acquired in a specific context of doing or creating. Even as I&rsquo;ve started to head off on tangents of my own, like diving deeply into Javascript prototypes last week, this learning is done to serve a purpose, to bring some piece of functionality into existence.</p>

<p>If you want to take the metaphor perhaps a little too far (which is always a fun exercise), it is almost like the project-based curriculum of Launch is OOP for your brain. Sure, you can gather knowledge together in your mind about a certain object, but these little tarballs of information are worthless until you start defining behaviors and passing messages between them. Knowledge as an object in and of itself does nothing &ndash; it is only once it starts to interact with other bits of information that the effect is meaningful.</p>
