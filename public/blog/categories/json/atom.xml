    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JSON is one of the major data formats out there on the web, known for its readability. Now, I was a little unsure about that readability aspect after pulling up my first JSON document and seeing this mess.</p>

<p><img src="http://gdurl.com/PP1x" alt="Crazy JSON!" /><br />
The first step towards wrapping your head around JSON is to see it printed in a prettier fashion. Head over to <a href="http://www.jsoneditoronline.org">JSON Online Editor</a> and using the “Open URL” option you can see that JSON data is actually much more presentable than it lets on. (If you need a JSON example to play with while reading this, don’t hesitate to use <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/johnkeith.json">my Treehouse profile</a>, as this provides you with a complex, multidimensional set of data to manipulate).</p>

<p>I decided to start by figuring out how to work with JSON in Ruby, as currently I certainly feel more comfortable with Ruby than Javascript. Luckily, Ruby makes handling JSON from the web easy with a few of its built in libraries and modules.</p>
