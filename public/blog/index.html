  <div class="entry-content"><p>As another part of our pre-work for Launch Academy, we’ve been asked to setup a blog. Luckily, I actually (miraculously) got this Octopress installation started back when I was applying to Launch. That said, I liked one of the writing prompts provided to us as part of this exercise - “Three Reasons I Felt Launch Academy Was the Best Fit for Me” - and I thought offering my three cents on why I’m heading to Launch could be informative for anyone else looking to apply to development bootcamps.</p>

<p><strong>Student-centric approach to everything</strong></p>

<p>Above all else, Launch Academy feels very student-centered. From the moment you start looking at their webpage to your first conversations with their experience engineers, the immediate impression you receive is that Launch is completely dedicated to their mission of transforming students from all walks of life into software engineers. Now, I’m sure many, many of the other bootcamps out there are equally fixated on this goal, but I felt that Launch Academy had the greatest commitment to their students of any of the programs I talked with. </p>

<p><strong>Excellent, comprehensive curriculum</strong></p>

<p>One of the parts of Launch Academy that I spent the most time dissecting before making my commitment to attend was the curriculum. I wanted to make sure that after Launch I would feel prepared to jump into the job market as a web developer. I can say from many conversations and emails with the Launch staff that I feel confident the program will provide the broad exposure and focus on fundamental skills to transform us into capable and confident web developers. </p>

<p><strong>Post-graduation assistance</strong></p>

<p>This may be part and parcel of Launch’s commitment to their students, but the career assistance that Launch offers to its graduates was another huge reason that I decided on them over other bootcamps. While many other programs talk about their tuition breaks for taking a job through a partner company, I believe Launch is much more focused on helping you find a job where you will both succeed and be happy, rather than one that benefits their partnerships. </p>

<p>And of course, Boston! Having come back from Korea almost three years ago, I’m ready for a new adventure and a radical change of scenery. While I will miss Columbia (weather-wise and otherwise), I cannot wait to come up to Boston in May. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Reader beware: I’m learning Rails right now. In no way, shape or form should this post or any posts here for at least the next month and a half be taken as gospel truth of how to do things right in Rails. They probably are way, way out in right field.</em></p>

<p>Okay, say you have a view and in that view you have a beautiful button. If you want to assign a name to that button dynamically, say based on the truthiness of some variable, here’s an easy way to do it. </p>

<p>Open up the _helper.rb file for your model. In your _helper file, write a method that will provide you two pieces of text, depending on a certain condition.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">sign_up_btn</span>
  <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="constant">User</span>.sign_up_allowed == <span class="predefined-constant">true</span>
    <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Prevent new account creation</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">else</span>
    <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Allow new account creation</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or, if you want to be fancy, try this refactored-while-in-the-midst-of-blogging-version. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">sign_up_btn</span>
  <span class="constant">User</span>.sign_up_allowed ? <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Prevent new account creation</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> : <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">Allow new account creation</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, back over in your view file, add this bit to create the button and assign it a title based on the results of the method above. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%=</span> button_to <span class="key">action</span>: <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">disallow_sign_up</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span><span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%=</span> <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">#{</span>sign_up_btn<span class="inline-delimiter">}</span></span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span><span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%</span> <span class="keyword">end</span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(Just so you get a fuller picture, here’s my disallow_sign_up method from my users_controller. I wrote it as a way for an admin to turn off access to the sign up page in the expense tracking app I’m working on.)</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">disallow_sign_up</span>
  <span class="constant">User</span>.sign_up_allowed ? <span class="constant">User</span>.sign_up_allowed = <span class="predefined-constant">false</span> : <span class="constant">User</span>.sign_up_allowed = <span class="predefined-constant">true</span>
  redirect_to users_index_path
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have a serious fixation on the ternary operator, if you haven’t noticed. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gems are amazing. As a rookie developer, it is incredible to come into the Ruby/Rails community and discover the wealth of code that is available out there, packaged and ready to be used. I’d encountered and enjoyed open source software before, but it was not until I started writing code that I really came to appreciate what the concept means.</p>

<p>Take for instance file uploading with Rails. You can perform basic uploads using what Rails offers natively or you can choose from a multitude of gems (Paperclip, Carrierwave, Dragonfly, the <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_file_uploads">list goes on</a>) that add more advanced methods of uploading and storing files in your Rails app. </p>

<p>For the expense tracker I am currently working on, I selected <a href="https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly">Dragonfly</a>. I’ll admit, I tried Paperclip first and I was unable to make it function correctly. My lack of success with Paperclip, however, was only half the reason I ended up with Dragonfly. </p>

<p>As I was envisioning document uploads in my app, I wanted the document (a receipt or invoice of a purchase) to become part of the Expenses table that I had already set up with a multitude of fields. With Paperclip, as far as I understood from the tutorials provided, it seemed like the documents would be set up as a separate model in the database, then associated with my current Expenses model. I can see advantages to the Paperclip approach (making all the documents easily accessible in one section of the database), but I wanted keep the relationships in this app as simple as possible, if only for my own sanity.</p>

<p>The great part about Dragonfly is it makes adding a :document column to your current model incredibly easy. The instructions below were what I did to install and integrate Dragonfly to upload documents when creating a new record in my Expense model. </p>

<p>First, I added Dragonfly to my gemfile and ran bundler.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>gem <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">dragonfly</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">~&gt;1.0.3</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ bundle install
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, in my app/models/expense.rb, I added an accessor for my document.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>dragonfly_accessor <span class="symbol">:document</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Back at the command line, I setup a migration to add a document column to my expenses model. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ Rails generate migration AddDocumentToExpenses
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Inside the migration document, I added two columns, one for the :document_uid and :document_name, per the <a href="http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/">Dragonfly wiki</a>.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="class">AddDocumentToExpenses</span> &lt; <span class="constant">ActiveRecord</span>::<span class="constant">Migration</span>
  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">change</span>
    add_column <span class="symbol">:expenses</span>, <span class="symbol">:document_uid</span>, <span class="symbol">:string</span>
    add_column <span class="symbol">:expenses</span>, <span class="symbol">:document_name</span>, <span class="symbol">:string</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then came migrating the database.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>rake db:migrate
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next was altering my app/views/expenses/_form.html.erb to include a field for file uploads. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="tag">&lt;div</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>=<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">field</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span><span class="tag">&gt;</span>
    <span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%=</span> f.label <span class="symbol">:document</span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span><span class="tag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
    <span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%=</span> f.file_field <span class="symbol">:document</span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then, inside my app/controllers/expenses_controller.rb, I added :document to the list of permitted parameters near the bottom. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="function">expense_params</span>
    params.require(<span class="symbol">:expense</span>).permit(<span class="symbol">:user_id</span>, <span class="symbol">:date</span>, <span class="symbol">:reseller</span>, <span class="symbol">:item_or_service</span>, <span class="symbol">:payment_form</span>, <span class="symbol">:charged_to</span>, <span class="symbol">:cost</span>, <span class="symbol">:amount_from_budget</span>, <span class="symbol">:notes</span>, <span class="symbol">:document</span>)
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the next step, I was unsure if this was the correct course to take. I was worried about my files being uploaded to the public folder, as I assumed anything in that area would be easily accessible from the outside. I created a directory in the root of my app called secure_storage, though I have no idea if that name is a complete misnomer. Then, I opened the config/initializers/dragonfly.rb and changed the default location for where files would be stored. Again, hopefully this will put them in a better location than the public directory, but I am not a hundred precent sure. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>datastore <span class="symbol">:file</span>,
  <span class="key">root_path</span>: <span class="constant">Rails</span>.root.join(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">secure_storage/system/dragonfly</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>, <span class="constant">Rails</span>.env),
  <span class="key">server_root</span>: <span class="constant">Rails</span>.root.join(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">'</span><span class="content">secure_storage</span><span class="delimiter">'</span></span>)
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, I added a file link (with a condition to make sure it didn’t appear if no file was present with the record) on the app/views/expenses/show.html.erb. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="instance-variable">@expense</span>.document <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span>
<span class="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Document:<span class="tag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
  <span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%=</span> link_to <span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">File</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>, root_url.chop + <span class="instance-variable">@expense</span>.document.url <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="inline"><span class="inline-delimiter">&lt;%</span> <span class="keyword">end</span> <span class="inline-delimiter">%&gt;</span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That, I believe, was all! You should now have a working file upload function, one that even lets you download the file too! If you try this and have trouble, let me know in the comments below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been using Evernote for a long time now and it has proven to be a fantastic system for storing information. That said, turning it into a system I can use to <em>organize</em> my life has been a Sisyphean experience. Over the years, my Evernote account has undergone a series of shakeups as I’ve tried out different organizational schemes, but each new system of handling notes, websites, and articles has left me feeling no more put together. </p>

<p>Part of our pre-work for Launch Academy has been to read a series of “brain hacking” books to get us ready for the start of the program. After diving into David Allen’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">Getting Things Done</a>, I think I may see a way to corral my ever-ballooning Evernote into a much more manageable and useful repository. </p>

<p>Currently, I open Evernote to a slew of notebook stacks and subnotebooks.</p>

<p><img src="http://gdurl.com/CL5X" alt="My current Evernote" /></p>

<p>While having many individual notebooks is a passable strategy, I’ve found that it becomes less and less useful the more notebooks you create. My count right now is over 50 and I think that might be 44 too many. </p>

<p>An overabundance of notebooks starts to cause problems when you try to send something Evernote from within an app (like a newsreader or through email), as it always becomes a question of how to categorize this piece of information. By default, my notes are routed into a folder I called _INCOMING. This has been a nice landing spot, but the vagueness of the name (or perhaps its linguistic proximity to “inbox”) has contributed to my lack of desire to sort through the massive flood of stuff that piles up in there.</p>

<p>In Allen’s book, he divides the organizational process into five stages: <strong>collect</strong>, <strong>process</strong>, <strong>organize</strong>, <strong>review</strong>, <strong>do</strong>. To reformat my Evernote to follow this system, I’m going to start by creating a _Processing folder and setting it as the default location for collecting everything that hits my Evernote. This will be the folder that I’ll take the time every other day to process the items from - to figure out “what they mean and what to do about them” (Allen). </p>

<p>From the processing folder, an item will have four places to go: into the NextSteps, Projects, Incubating, or Archives folder. </p>

<p>In the NextSteps folder will be all todo items, things that need to be done in the short term or short term actions that need to be taken in relation to longer term projects or goals. </p>

<p>In the Projects folder will reside all of the <em>active</em> ideas or projects that I’m working on at the moment. And, as in <strong>Getting Things Done</strong>, the term projects is defined in a different sense than we usually use, as “any desired result that requires more than one action step” (Allen).</p>

<p>The Incubating (I wanted to use a more active term than Allen’s “incubation”) folder will house the more lofty and long term items - app ideas, career goals, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the Archives folder, I’m going to store everything that resides in my current notebooks. In other words, the Archives folder is essentially going to house everything that passes through my Evernote - it is the final destination of all information.</p>

<p>I think this is the key to any organizational system - there must be a logical, actionable flow of information through the system, including a final resting place where the inactive information may be stored and retrieved. </p>

<p>Since Evernote does such a great job with indexing and searching any and every piece of information inside your account, I feel that there is no need to employ the tagging feature, that it might only slow down the movement of information into and through the new system. I’m going to spend some time not using tagging and see how it goes. </p>

<p>Allen emphasizes the important of reviewing the items in your organizational system at least once a week. I would love if it was possible to create a recurring reminder in Evernote that would alert me when I should review the information I have in each of my actionable folders (NextSteps, Projects, and Incubating), but for now perhaps a weekly calendar alert will suffice. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can’t remember where I read it, but recently I came across the advice that one of the best ways to practice programming is to recreate the type of applications you use everyday. No need to make them flashy, simply implement their core features in order to achieve the same results. </p>

<p>I decided to give it a try today and build a tiny todo app in Ruby. I wanted to write the app keeping in mind the directives from Sandi’s Metz’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Remember that a class should do the smallest possible useful thing. That
thing ought to be simple to describe. If the simplest description you can devise uses the
word “and,” the class likely has more than one responsibility.​” - Metz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it ended up that my app only had one class, I tried to follow in the spirit of the quote above by keeping my methods as focused as possible. I also tried to heed her advice to stave off design decisions for as long as possible - an interesting strategy that had me trying to store all completed and incomplete todos in the same file. I quickly realized, though, that this was an inefficient way of doing things, since my completed items list would (hopefully) be a far larger file than my active items list and there is no reason to load that large file every time the app is opened.</p>

<p>There is one little quirk that I can’t seem to shake: when you mark a todo as finished, the item is removed from the activelist.txt file, but is not added to the completelist.txt file until you close the program. I’m sure it has something to do with the file opening modes I selected, but I can’t figure out why I am able to modify and then view the modifications done to activelist.txt while in the app, but not do the same with completelist.txt.</p>

<p>In the end, this was a great way to get practice using the File and IO classes of Ruby and exploring their methods. Not to mention, I get a pretty nifty little command line todo list manager (which I’ll stick in Dropbox for easy access) out of it! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Heroku only allows for 300 MB of storage for their free tier of hosting, it makes sense to store the images for an Octopress site in a separate location. Previously, I used Flickr for a few posts, but the process of uploading the files and hunting down the embed link was tiresome. </p>

<p>The better way, it seems, is to use Google Drive, despite the fact that Google doesn’t provide an easy way to embed either. What makes using Google Drive much friendlier than Flickr, however, is a site called <a href="http://gdurl.com/​">gdURL</a>. </p>

<p>With gdURL, all you need to do is share an image file on Google Drive, change the privacy settings to “Anyone who has the link can view”, then run the link Google Drive provides you through the gdURL service and you receive a tidy, bite-sized link for embedding your image. </p>

<p>For instance, I used gdURL in the following line to link to a picture of this site’s new theme.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>![So Fresh and So Green](http://gdurl.com/i4Wr)​
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><img src="http://gdurl.com/i4Wr" alt="So Fresh and So Green" />​</p>

<p>Quick, easy, and keeps the size of your Octopress repo down.</p>
