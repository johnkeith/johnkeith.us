  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can’t remember where I read it, but recently I came across the advice that one of the best ways to practice programming is to recreate the type of applications you use everyday. No need to make them flashy, simply implement their core features in order to achieve the same results. </p>

<p>I decided to give it a try today and build a tiny todo app in Ruby. I wanted to write the app keeping in mind the directives from Sandi’s Metz’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Remember that a class should do the smallest possible useful thing. That
thing ought to be simple to describe. If the simplest description you can devise uses the
word “and,” the class likely has more than one responsibility.​” - Metz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it ended up that my app only had one class, I tried to follow in the spirit of the quote above by keeping my methods as focused as possible. I also tried to heed her advice to stave off design decisions for as long as possible - an interesting strategy that had me trying to store all completed and incomplete todos in the same file. I quickly realized, though, that this was an inefficient way of doing things, since my completed items list would (hopefully) be a far larger file than my active items list and there is no reason to load that large file every time the app is opened.</p>

<p>There is one little quirk that I can’t seem to shake: when you mark a todo as finished, the item is removed from the activelist.txt file, but is not added to the completelist.txt file until you close the program. I’m sure it has something to do with the file opening modes I selected, but I can’t figure out why I am able to modify and then view the modifications done to activelist.txt while in the app, but not do the same with completelist.txt.</p>

<p>In the end, this was a great way to get practice using the File and IO classes of Ruby and exploring their methods. Not to mention, I get a pretty nifty little command line todo list manager (which I’ll stick in Dropbox for easy access) out of it! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Heroku only allows for 300 MB of storage for their free tier of hosting, it makes sense to store the images for an Octopress site in a separate location. Previously, I used Flickr for a few posts, but the process of uploading the files and hunting down the embed link was tiresome. </p>

<p>The better way, it seems, is to use Google Drive, despite the fact that Google doesn’t provide an easy way to embed either. What makes using Google Drive much friendlier than Flickr, however, is a site called <a href="http://gdurl.com/​">gdURL</a>. </p>

<p>With gdURL, all you need to do is share an image file on Google Drive, change the privacy settings to “Anyone who has the link can view”, then run the link Google Drive provides you through the gdURL service and you receive a tidy, bite-sized link for embedding your image. </p>

<p>For instance, I used gdURL in the following line to link to a picture of this site’s new theme.</p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>![So Fresh and So Green](http://gdurl.com/i4Wr)​
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><img src="http://gdurl.com/i4Wr" alt="So Fresh and So Green" />​</p>

<p>Quick, easy, and keeps the size of your Octopress repo down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been meaning to build an Octopress theme since I put this site up back in January. To start with, this blog was using the <a href="https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace">Whitespace theme</a>, which was a fantastic starting point, but I wanted to create something with a little more…color! </p>

<p>After reading Vladi’s post about creating a theme called <a href="http://vladigleba.com/blog/2013/10/31/introducing-readify-a-new-octopress-theme-focused-on-readibility/">Readify</a>, I was inspired to take a shot at it. </p>

<p>To that end…here’s what I’ve got so far. The code is <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/sofreshandsogreen">available here</a>, should you want to install it on your own Octopress! I reworked the Classc theme to include a few basic changes that hopefully will make it more readable and usable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Larger font and line heights</li>
  <li>Fixed navbar that becomes unfixed on mobile devices</li>
  <li>Green everywhere!</li>

I’ve made a ton of stuff working off of Bootstrap templates and Wordpress themes, but I also really love creating sites without all the mess of those big frameworks. I want to hand code sites to keep learning about the presentational side of web development, but an environment like Rails is not ideal for such explorations. Even the much more manageable Sinatra is only a little better, as I feel like my focus when building something in Sinatra is split evenly between the front-end and back-end. </p>

<p>That said, after finding and playing with <a href="http://www.middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>, I believe it provides the perfect way to focus on the front-end of things without sacrificing the power of HAML, SASS and the like. The LiveReload extension is also amazing - it is incredible how small efficiencies make all the differences when writing and testing out new ideas. </p>

<p>I was really thrilled when I managed to figure out how to insert Markdown files into a HAML template built in a Middleman project. </p>

<div><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="class">.main-contain</span>
  <span class="class">.pure-g-r</span>
    <span class="class">.pure-u-1-2</span>
      <span class="tag">%h1</span> Hello folks.
    <span class="class">.pure-u-1-2</span>
      <span class="tag">%p</span> What up?
<span class="comment">      :markdown</span><span class="comment">
        #{File.read(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), &quot;test.md&quot;))}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The code is nothing special, but being able to read a file of Markdown text and insert it into my template was pretty exciting. I’m planning to use this trick to create a text-heavy site that keeps its content as separate from the presentation as possible by inserting all the large chunks of text as Markdown files into templates. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been meaning to take some time and learn one of the HTML templating engines. One of the best parts about the <a href="http://www.codepen.com">Codepen</a> site is that it is a great place to practice with engines like HAML and Slim. (Not to mention, doing so gives me a chance to try installing the Codepen plugin here on my Octopress). </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the wonderful break from school here at the holidays, I decided to join Treehouse and explore this popular learning platform (and maybe pick up a little Objective C and iOS while I’m at it!). I’m on day three of a two week trial and so far I’ve been impressed by the site and its fantastic array of offerings, despite my devotion to Codeacademy. That said, after completing Treehouse’s <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/usability-foundations">Usability Foundations</a> course and dipping my toes into the iOS Development track, I certainly have run across a few areas that could use improvement. </p>

<p>Before diving into the usability issues I’ve experienced, let me say that I have really enjoyed Treehouse thus far. I was initially wary of the video-lecture style that defines the Treehouse delivery mechanism, but I think there is something to be said for adding the human element of an embodied teacher when learning to code. While the learn-by-watching method of Treehouse differs greatly from the Codeacademy approach (code, code, code!), I am currently enjoying it as I start trying to unpack the verbosity of Objective C. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I have experienced some quirky behaviors after the video segments are done and you start to do the Code Challenges and other quizzes. There is a noticeable delay (as in 7 to 10 seconds) in between when completing the final exercise in a coding exercise (receiving the message “Congrats! You completed the challenge!”) and when the dialogue box appears telling you how many points the completion earns. </p>

<p><img src="/images/postimg/nsstringChallenge.png" /></p>

<p>I’ve noticed this delay only occurs the first time you are completing a Code Challenge, not if you go back and retake a challenge. That fact, however, brings up another problem: when you complete a challenge you have already completed, you are still presented with a dialogue box telling you points are being awarded! It is certainly a little confusing to receive the message that I have earned 6 points for completing the NSString challenge, but then not see any change in my overall score. </p>

<p>I think the fixes in these cases could be straightforward. Simply offer a loading indicator if the long delay between challenge completion and points awarding is unavoidable. Then, if retaking a challenge already completed, make sure the dialogue box at the end mentions that this challenge has already been passed and no new points will be awarded. </p>

<p>In terms of quizzes, there are a few pedagogical problems when you answer a question incorrectly. On the iPad app, the user is given little feedback when a question is answered incorrectly - all you get is a red box and an unhappy beep. The web interface offers an experience that is much the same (an incorrect answer garners a message of “Bummer! Unfortunately, that answer is incorrect.”). </p>

<p><img src="/images/postimg/bummerAnswer.png" /></p>

<p>What I really find frustrating is not this method of handling incorrect answers - the quiz should not tell you the correct answer as you are taking it, in case you do not pass. The problem arises when you reach the end of a quiz, perhaps with one incorrect answer, and are awarded your points without having a chance to review the question you answered incorrectly. </p>

<p><img src="/images/postimg/incorrectAnswerPassing.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have run into this scenario multiple times on the iOS track: I’ve missed a question that I would love to know the answer to, but I have to retake the entire quiz to attempt the question again. This is a highly inefficient setup for both the user and the system.</p>

<p>Again, I think this usability problem might have a simple fix. Perhaps, at the end of quizzes on the iPad and the web interface, add a button that says “Review incorrect answers” that allows the user to review the question(s) they missed. </p>

<p>Changing gears, I’ve also found that navigating to courses and tracks you are currently enrolled in is not the easiest, both on  the web and the iPad app. With the iPad app, one tap when you open the app brings up the dashboard and shows you what track you are working on, then one more tap takes you right into the section of the track you are on. </p>

<p><img src="/images/postimg/dashboardiPad.jpg" /></p>

<p>That said, you still have to scroll down to the lecture or quiz you left off at, but this is a minor inconvenience. </p>

<p>When you login to the web interface, you are presented with a Dashboard page that shows the current track you are on and a button to resume your progress, as with the iPad app. </p>

<p><img src="/images/postimg/dashboardWeb.png" /></p>

<p>What is lacking from both interfaces, however, is any indication of other courses a user might be currently working through. (For example, though I am on the iOS Development track, I have also been watching lectures and taking quizzes from Usability Foundations, Career Foundations, and Database Foundations). Neither on the Dashboard page nor on my profile page is there a link to any of the other courses from the Treehouse Library that I’m working to finish. Having to click or tap on Library and then navigate through multiple layers to find the course I have started is difficult and undoubtedly poor from a usability standpoint. </p>

<p>Perhaps what Treehouse could do is offer a more informative Dashboard page. In the Welcome Home section of the web interface, current courses could be listed alongside the current track, accompanied by resume buttons. The same holds true on the iPad app - under the In Progress section, the current courses could also be visible and tapable. </p>

<p>Treehouse is an awesome product and I’m excited about continuing to explore its many facets, but I do hope the Treehouse Team will tighten up some aspects of the experience. I believe the few small tweaks above could easily make Treehouse one of the best online learning platforms available for aspiring developers.</p>
